Hello! My full name is Maulana Ahmad Aji Triadi, but you may call me Maulana. I am a devoted software engineer; I love designing cool, efficient digital solutions. I have been doing web development for quite some time now, and it has equipped me with lots of different skills to build dynamic and user-friendly websites. I am all about keeping up with the latest tech and trends in this ever-changing world of web development. I'm really into creating awesome, good-looking online experiences.

So, my familyâ€™s from the eastern part of Indonesia, specifically the Yapen Islands. Back in 2006, I first got into computers with this old tube computer my parents had because the internet was pretty scarce where we lived. To get online, we had to use a telephone cable, which made it kinda pricey to do anything online. So, during that time, I mostly played offline games since the internet was such a hassle to deal with.

So, in 2008, I moved to Yogyakarta, and it wasn't until 2014 that I got back into computers due to easier access to the internet in internet cafes. At that time, I really got into figuring out how the internet works and joining an online programming community. My web programming journey kicked off with Visual Basic 6.0, where I made some simple programs, and later, jumped into PHP while working on a social media management system. Meanwhile, I started blogging in hopes of earning through AdSense <sup>1</sup>.

In 2014, I began to work on graphic design, plunging into logo design contests and helping my friends with their projects. Then, in the year 2018, my programming spark again lit up when my teacher pushed me to participate in this district-level programming competition, and guess what? I won the second place!

After vocational school, I joined Amikom University Yogyakarta, and my eagerness to learn programming was revived with the help of my classmates. I graduated by completing my thesis on "Application of Personal Extreme Programming on The Design of The Sales Information System Application of The Lepas Rindu Coffee Shop Using Laravel." Currently, I'm deep into a bunch of freelance gigs and trying to get better at some new programming languages like Golang and React. While I work on my personal website with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, I was checking out bento grid layouts and getting inspiration from sites like Nev's, which are, in my opinion, super cool.
